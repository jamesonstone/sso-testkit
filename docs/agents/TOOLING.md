# Tooling

## Skills

- Repo-local canonical skills live under `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- For feature-scoped work, start with the current feature's canonical front matter `skills`, falling back to the legacy `SPEC.md` `## SKILLS` table only when front matter is absent
- Keep the selected skill set minimal and actionable

## Command Capability Discovery

- Use `kit capabilities` when choosing among Kit commands and the mutation, network, write, or git behavior is not already obvious.
- Use `kit capabilities <command> --json` for one command path, including nested paths such as `rules add` or `skill mine`.
- Use `kit capabilities --search <term> --json` for compact filtered discovery, and `kit capabilities --full --json` only when hidden or deprecated compatibility commands matter.
- Treat `kit capabilities` itself as read-only: it does not require a Kit project root and does not load project config, write files, call the network, run subprocesses, or mutate git.
- In downstream Kit-managed projects, load `docs/references/rules/kit-capabilities-usage.md` when command discovery affects the task.
- Downstream projects should use `kit capabilities` for command discovery; do not maintain Kit's internal command catalog from a downstream project.

## Dispatch

- Use `kit dispatch` when broad work must be turned into safe multi-lane execution
- Use subagents when the work cleanly separates into low-overlap lanes after discovery
- Keep broad or noisy discovery in RLM first; use dispatch or direct subagent execution only after the relevant workstreams are narrow enough to predict overlap
- Predict overlap conservatively before parallelizing
- Keep the main agent responsible for synthesis, integration, validation, and communication

## PR Review Feedback

- Use `kit pr fix` as the default PR review feedback entrypoint when current PR review feedback should become an editable dispatch prompt.
- With no `--pr`, `kit pr fix` lists open pull requests in the current repository and asks which one to repair.
- Use `kit pr fix --pr <target>` when the PR is known; accepted targets match dispatch PR intake: URL, Markdown link, `owner/repo#number`, or current-repo number.
- `kit pr fix` uses the prompt-producing `kit dispatch --pr` path: it pre-populates the editor with unresolved review feedback, lets the user edit the task list, and copies the resulting dispatch prompt for a coding agent.
- The generated PR-fix prompt requires a post-push reflection cycle before review-thread resolution: the coding agent must review the pushed diff in context, confirm the PR head still matches the commit it pushed, and only then resolve verified addressed conversations.
- `kit pr fix` does not run the loop agent, edit files, write `.kit/loops` evidence, stage, commit, push, post PR comments, or resolve review threads.
- Use `kit loop review` when changed code should be locally reviewed and repaired by the configured loop agent until the final response reports at least 95% correctness and ends with `done`.
- Without `--pr`, `kit loop review` reviews current-branch changes relative to `origin/main`, falling back to local `main`, plus staged and unstaged changes.
- Use `kit loop review --pr <target>` when current unresolved CodeRabbit PR feedback should be opportunistically folded into the repair loop while local review starts immediately.
- Use `kit loop review --pr <target> --watch` or `--wait-for-coderabbit` only when finalization should block for CodeRabbit completion.
- Review prompts use one agent by default; pass `--subagents` to let the parent review agent pre-analyze the diff and choose subagents only when the lanes are clearly independent under `agent-team-orchestration` limits.
- Use `kit dispatch --loop --pr <target>` when current unresolved CodeRabbit PR review feedback should become a human-reviewed dispatch prompt instead of an agent repair loop.
- Use `kit dispatch --pr <target> --coderabbit` only when you need raw unresolved CodeRabbit review-thread intake without review-loop watch, classification, or summary behavior.
- Treat `kit loop review` as local repair only: it may edit files through the configured agent and write `.kit/loops` evidence, but it must not stage, commit, push, post PR comments, or resolve review threads.
- After fixes or no-op decisions are complete, validation has run, the repair is pushed, and reflection confirms no other code was pushed after the repair commit, resolve matching current unresolved review threads on the PR, including human reviewer and CodeRabbit feedback, with `kit dispatch --pr <target> --resolve --yes`.
- Resolve only feedback verified as fixed or intentionally no-op; do not resolve unfixed, uncertain, stale, or unrelated feedback.
- `kit dispatch --pr <target> --resolve --yes` is an explicit GitHub mutation and must not be run speculatively.

## Project Directory

- Work in the existing project directory by default
- Do not create or use git worktrees for agent work
- If the current branch or dirty state is unsuitable, stop and ask the user how to proceed instead of creating an alternate checkout

## Secondary Global Inputs

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- `${CODEX_HOME}/AGENTS.md`
- `${CODEX_HOME}/instructions.md`
- `${CODEX_HOME}/skills/*/SKILL.md`

- Treat these as secondary context after repo-local docs
- Do not use `.claude/skills` as canonical discovery input
